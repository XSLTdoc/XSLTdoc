## Running

See the [home page](http://www.pnp-software.com/XSLTdoc/) for more
detailed instructions.

Since those were written, we've added a very primitive bash script, so that
if you have bash available, you should put the "bin" subdirectory of this
project into your PATH, and then you can run it as:

```
xsltdoc <config-file>
```

## Building

You don't need to build this project in order to run it.

Install and run ant. The default task builds the pages for the home page,
and writes them to the doc directory.

This uses SaxonHE 9 to run the XSLT transformations. It is downloaded
automatically, the first time you run the ant build.

Use `ant -p` to see a list of tasks.
